This is my first time playing with jekyll.  I already don't like the website builder.  I think I was just impatient with waiting for the sub-domain to point to there, or it's not possible.  I kept getting redirected to something odd.

This is already taking up more time than I wanted to waste tonight, but it's pretty cool that GitHub will let me host this for free.

I don't like it.  It's ugly.  What the website builder produced was far more pretty to look at!

This wasn't even my goal for this evening.

But I have e-mail!  And at least I've started doing my own blog rather than using a builder?

Flux is already making it harder to see the screen...

And I haven't watched today's Westworld!

I need to stop starting sentences with conjunctions.

I should really be in bed.  I'm already getting sick.
